This application was developed as part of the [Connex Telecommunica.ons Angular / Java Project](TakeHome_Assignment_FullStack.pdf) challenge.

It is a Spring Boot Reactive Webflux application that also serves static resources.
The deployment target is [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/pm/lambda/?gclid=CjwKCAiAg9urBhB_EiwAgw88mWpuXpF1A-NlF4KIEZn2r5DpEm5N-3IIyPomc_8y4a_Ze2vKXoMs6BoCvksQAvD_BwE&trk=d87368f2-b0ac-4e30-804b-b10e2d25d291&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAiAg9urBhB_EiwAgw88mWpuXpF1A-NlF4KIEZn2r5DpEm5N-3IIyPomc_8y4a_Ze2vKXoMs6BoCvksQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651612781100!e!!g!!aws%20lambda!19836398320!150095228874), featuring a self-shutdown mechanism to prevent continuous running of the Lambda function.

The Lambda function initializes promptly (within 4 seconds) upon receiving a request at its URL. Importantly, multiple instances of the Lambda function are never executed simultaneously.

The application leverages the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server) cloud NoSQL database for data storage.

The computation of a premium involves a set of configurations initialized by Spring Boot in a NavigableMap.
This design allows us to modify rules without redeploying the application, thanks to the integration with a config server.
